Predicting number of views/comments for news articles on cracked.com based on their headlines and text.

- Collect news articles
	- Crawl
		- http://www.nu.nl/
		- Access #comments (<span id=commentCounts>)
- Process text
	- Remove stopwords
- Store news articles
	- Database (MongoDB)
	- Collections
		- Article (title, text, number of comments)
- Select features
	- Title
	- Text
- Define classes
	- Determine highest number of views/comments
	- Very low, low, medium, high, very high
- Learn (article -> #views/comments) relationship using different ML algorithms
	- Naive Bayes classifier (categorical)
		- Calculate word frequencies
	- k-NN (categorical)
	- Linear regression (continuous)
	- Logistic regression (categorical)
	- Decision tree
		- Classification tree (categorical)
		- Regression tree (continuous)
- Predict views for new articles
	- Category (low, medium, high #comments), or amount (x amount of comments)
- Evaluate
	- Divide data into training and test data
	- Check prediction accuracy afterwards
	- Update models according to results
